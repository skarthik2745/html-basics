        <p>A flower, also known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure of flowering plants. It typically consists of petals, sepals, a stamen (male part), and a pistil (female part). Flowers are often brightly colored and fragrant, making them a popular gift and a beautiful part of nature. They are also essential for the plant's reproduction, as they produce the seeds that can grow into new plants. </p>
