    <p>
      A flower, also known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure
      of flowering plants. It typically consists of petals, sepals, a stamen
      (male part), and a pistil (female part).
      <span class="sk">
        Flowers are often brightly colored and fragrant, making them a popular
        gift and a beautiful part of nature.
      </span>
      They are also essential for the plant's reproduction, as they produce the
      seeds that can grow into new plants.
