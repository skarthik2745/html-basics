      A flower, also known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure
      of flowering plants. It typically consists of petals, sepals, a stamen
      (male part), and a pistil (female part). Flowers are often brightly
      colored and fragrant, making them a popular gift and a beautiful part of
      nature. They are also essential for the plant's reproduction, as they
      produce the seeds that can grow into new plants.
